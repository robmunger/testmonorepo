description: A website to expand upon the slides

A dilemma:
- I'd like a website to distribute my slides on after meetings.
- Slightly different versions should appear on the website and in the slides.

<!--→Some content will only be in the ***slides***. ←-->

Other content will only be on the ***website***. Typically, the version on the website will be much more detailed. The best slides are very concise because they are accompanied by a verbal presentation. In contrast, the website must stand alone. Therefore, it needs far more information!<!--⬅️-->
